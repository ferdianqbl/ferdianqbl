## Hi, I'm Ferdi <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10743728/100195412-e2ca3780-2f29-11eb-98b0-26af8496f704.gif" width="36px" /> 
I am a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in Frontend development. I am highly proficient in working with the React ecosystem, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS, delivering seamless and responsive user interfaces.

With a strong foundation in application development, I have developed a keen interest in Data Science and UI/UX Design, continuously seeking to improve both the functionality and usability of the products I build. I am always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.
